    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)? \n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Primary goals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) :\n",
    "Reusability: OOP allows developers to create reusable code by breaking down large problems into smaller, more manageable chunks. This makes it easier to maintain and update code, as well as to create new applications.\n",
    "Robustness: OOP makes code more robust by encapsulating data and behavior within objects. This makes it easier to protect data from unauthorized access, and to prevent errors from propagating throughout an application.\n",
    "Adaptability: OOP makes code more adaptable by allowing developers to extend and modify existing classes. This makes it easier to accommodate changes in requirements, and to add new features to an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an object in Python? \n",
    "Python object is a data structure that encapsulates data and behavior (functions/methods) together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a class in Python? \n",
    "A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors of objects belonging to that class. It serves as a template for creating multiple instances of similar objects with shared attributes and methods.\n",
    "4. What are attributes and methods in a class? \n",
    "Attributes in a class are variables that store data, representing the characteristics or properties of an object.\n",
    "Methods in a class are functions that define the behavior or actions that the object can perform\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python? \n",
    "Class variables are variables that are shared by all instances of a class. They are defined inside the class but outside any method. \n",
    "Instance variables, on the other hand, are unique to each instance of the class and are defined within the class methods using the \"self\" keyword.\n",
    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods? \n",
    "The purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods is to refer to the instance of the class itself. It allows class methods to access and modify the instance's attributes and behavior.\n",
    "Ex:\n",
    "class Car: \n",
    "def __init__(self, name): \n",
    "self.name = name \n"
